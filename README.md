This repository was forked from the UBerGames rpgxEF repository located here: https://github.com/UberGames/rpgxEF.
This is an attempt by The Last Outpost (www.last-outpost.net) to clean up the source code in order to get it to 
build with Visual Studio 2015 and be able to maintain it more easily in the future.
